README file for mod_eppd apache module
--------------------------------------

In order to minimize documentation effort and inconsitencies, only one source
of documentation is maintained, which is generated by doxygen. To generate
documentation type "make doc" (assuming you have installed doxygen) and then
you can start browsing web docs at doc/html/index.html.
