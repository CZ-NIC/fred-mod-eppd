README file for mod_eppd apache module
--------------------------------------

In order to minimize documentation effort and inconsitencies, only one source
of documentation is maintained, which is generated by doxygen. To generate
documentation type "make doc" (assuming you have installed doxygen) and then
you can start browsing web docs at doc/html/index.html.

In documentation generated by doxygen you can find:

  *) General description of mod_eppd
  *) Architecture overview
  *) Configuration description
  *) Installation guide
  *) Debugging Howto

If you don't have installed doxygen tools or you don't want to install it,
you can view the raw doxygen source file doc/mainpage.h.

As a startpoint when configuring mod_eppd, you can use httpd-epp.conf file.
