2006-01-02 Jan Kryl (version ?.?.?)

	* New email pattern was defined. Now every email address has to
	fulfill quite basic criteria.

	* NotifyEmail could not be deleted, because it was not allowed to
	enter empty NotifyEmail tag in update. This is fixed now.

2006-01-02 Jan Kryl (version 1.2.0)

	* New foundation for extending EPP protocol by new commands was layed
	out. The new commands have similar structure as classic EPP commands,
	but they are nested in 'extension' element. The foundation is defined
	in fred-1.0.xsd.

	* Type of domain registrant in update was corrected.

	* New command for sending of authinfo to an owner of object was
	defined. This change is part of new model of transfer.

	* Since now a client is not able to set status on objects. The schemas
	were adapted to this change.

	* ssn element was renamed to 'ident'. ssn element was left in
	schemas for compatibility reasons, but its use is discouraged.

	* Technical contact is now mandatory when creating nsset.

	* ExDate is not of type datetime but just date.

	* authInfo type is now mandatory when transfering an object.

	* authInfo element was simplified and now contains directly
	the plain text password instead of subelement identifying type
	of password.

	* The not used feature of entering authinfo in command info was
	canceled. AuthInfo element in info command is forbidden.

	* New command for invocation of technical check on nsset was added.
	The results of technical check are returned asynchronously by means
	of poll message. The structure of poll message was defined too.

	* New element 'reportlevel' was added to nsset schema. Element sets
	level of technical tests performed on nsset and is part of create,
	update and info commands on nsset.

	* Structure of new poll message was defined - message about completed
	transfer.

	* Version on all changed schemas was bumped up. This is first time
	we changed version of schemas.

2006-09-26 Jan Kryl (version 1.1.1)

	* authInfo element is optional since now upon creation of object.
	In case that it is empty, the server will generate random authinfo
	for object.

	* pwAuthInfoType has now limited length to 300 characters. This was
	accomplished by move of definition from eppcom to fredcom schema.

2006-09-21 Jan Kryl (version 1.1.0)

	* This ChangeLog was created in order to document changes in schemas.

	* Official specification of register says, that there can be from 2
	to 10 nameservers in nsset. The upper bound was 9 till now, so it
	was incremented by one.

	* New schema fredcom-1.0.xsd was introduced in order to gather
	datatypes common for multiple schemas. It is an equivalent of
	eppcom-1.0, but since this schema is part of EPP standard, it cannot
	be modified.

	* Data type of nsset and contact id was changed. Original type from
	eppcom was to short. New type 'objIDType' is defined in fredcom.
	As consequence the type of client's identifier is no more the same
	as identifier of object.

	* Not used parts inherited from original standard schemas, which were
	commented out, were deleted, in order to prevent confusion when
	reading the schemas.
