 1. Versioning
------------------

The versioning of schemas is a bit confusing and will be explained in this
text. Each schema file has its own version, major and minor. Client and
server must always adhere to the same version of particular schema in order
to avoid any misunderstanding and proper operation. The version of schemas
is announced in greeting from server.

ChangeLog is currently maintained only in czech language and versions in
ChangeLog are derived from versions of mod_eppd. If you want to know if
your particular client of version x.y.z is compatible with server (mod_eppd)
of version a.b.c, check Compat chapter in this README.
