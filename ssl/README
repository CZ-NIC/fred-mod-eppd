This directory contains certificate and it's associated private key for
purpose of test EPP communication with FRED registry. There are three types
of certificates involved in EPP communication.

1. Certificate od certification autorithy (CA). All two remaining certificate
need to be signed by this CA certificate

2. SSL server certificate. Standard SSL communitation requires server to
authenticate itself by this certificate. Clients can validate informations
from this certificate with connection

3. SSL client certificates. Every client (registrar) must have client
certificate to initiate SSL connection. Server validate this certificate
through CA certificate and compare it's MD5 with data stored in database
along with registrar login informations

Server side EPP configuration needs first and second of this certificates. 
For testing purpose we use same certificate in these two roles. This
certificate can even play a role of client certificate.

This certificate was created by two calls to openssl:

openssl req -new -nodes -keyout test-key.pem -subj /C=CZ/L=Prague/O=CZ.NIC/OU=Registry/CN=localhost/ | openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -signkey test-key.pem -out test-cert.pem
