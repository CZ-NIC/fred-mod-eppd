This document describes differences between epp standard as described in
rfc 3730 and object mappings in rfc 3731, 3732, 3733 and our implementation.

	*) New object mapping nsset was defined to ease work with groups of
	nameservers. Standard methods of binding nameservers to specific domain
	through ns attribute and host object are not supported.

	*) New object mapping for domain (which is not compatible with standard
	rfc 3731) was introduced. This is consequence of having nsset instead
	of ns attribute and host object.

	*) New object mapping for contact is used (which is not compatible with
	standard rfc 3733). There are not international and local versions of
	address, name and organization. Additional attributes of object contact
	are: notify_email, vat, ssn.

	*) Objects, which the client is willing to work with, are send
	according to standard as part of <login> frame. In our implementation,
	client after authentication can access any object, which was announced
	to be supported in <greeting> frame, no matter what did he/she sent in
	<login> frame.

	*) AuthInfo in <info> for all objects is ignored.

	*) Information about pending messages is sent only when explicitly
	requested by <poll> command.
