This document describes differences between epp standard as described in
rfc 3730, 3731, 3732, 3733 and our implementation.

	*) Objects, which the client is willing to work with, are send according
	to standard as part of <login> frame. In our implementation, client
	after authentication can access any object, no matter what did he/she
	sent in <login> frame.

	*) AuthInfo in <info> for all objects is ignored.
