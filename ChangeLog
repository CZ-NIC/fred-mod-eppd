2008-06-20 Jaromir Talir (1.7.0)

	* Minor configuration and build enhancements

	* Apache log messages translated in log file

2008-02-29 Jiri Sadek (version 1.6.1)

	* added configuration option 'EPPdeferErrors <num>' for defering
	all epp error response codes (those >=2000) - ticket #1400

2008-02-08 Jiri Sadek (version 1.6.0)

	* Release 1.6.0

	* Fixed double logout call to Central Register when user issue proper
	connection close.

2008-01-12 Jaromir Talir

	* Adding test ssl certificate and updating test configuration
	
	* RPM support added and other small autotools changes

2008-01-10 Jiri Sadek

	* Automake support and autoconf somewhat rewritten

	* Log message after successfuly initialization uniformalized with
	other modules

2007-11-07 Jan Kryl (version 1.5.1)

	* Minor issues pointed by a coverity test were fixed.

	* Hack to accomodate connection closing on certain return codes
	was incorporated. In future the logic should be incorporated in
	CORBA interface.

	* New option -p of epp_test can be used to test corba nameservice
	functionality.

2007-09-26 Jan Kryl (version 1.5.0)

	* New mechanism of creating poll message's content. The XML of message
	is created in mod_eppd and not in central register. Maintenance
	of XML generators scattered all over the central register was a
	nightmare.

	* Upon tcp connection close is called new CORBA function which signals
	this event to Central Register. Central register in response deletes
	a session entry from its table, so that it doesn't get overfilled by
	stale connections.

	* Bugfix in test_nsset function, which didn't properly incremented
	index in a list and led to segmentation fault.

	* XML response is send for archivation to central-register only if
	it has real svTRID assigned by Central register (otherwise the CR
	is not able to pair the response with request).

2007-09-19 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.4)

	* Remove bashism from Makefile (output redirection).

2007-07-26 Jaromir Talir (version 1.4.3)
	
	* Simple schema change.

2007-07-13 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.2)

	* Error messages triggered by XML validator were using namespaces
	which were not declared.

	* Bug in update of ident attribute was fixed. It was not possible
	to nullify ident attribute.

2007-06-25 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.1)

	* Viewport of client's document identifing an error was cut out
	without proper modifications, which resulted in usage of namespaces
	which were not defined. This is fixed now.

	* The input XML documents sent to central register for archivation
	are encoded in UTF-8. The old behaviour of sending the raw text
	could result in db insert failure, if the input was encoded in other
	than UTF-8 encoding.

	* The policy when required parameter is not returned from central
	register was changed. Mod_eppd generates invalid XML and logs the
	error.

	* The ident type birthday was not tranformed in output XML. This was
	fixed.

	* Disclose on vat, ident and notifyEmail was not displayed in output
	XML. This was fixed.

	* Changes in XML schemas - see schemas' changelog for more detailed
	information. Schemas versions were bumped up.

version 1.4.0

	* Configuration utilities (apr-config, apxs, pkg-config) are run
	as part of configure rather than in makefile. Makefile gets real
	parameters and not just paths of these utilities. I belive it's
	more correct solution.

	* Missing tests for header files as well as errors in 'with' parameters
	in configure.ac were corrected.

	* mod_eppd creates "dummy answer" if it cannot get response from
	some reason from CORBA server. Dummy answer looks like normal error
	response, but the svtrid is faked. If the error occures during
	the first greeting, the mod_eppd closes the connection without
	responding with error message, which is the same behaviour as before.

	* Again changes in XML schemas, see schemas' changelog for more
	information. Schemas versions were bumped up.

version 1.3.1

	* New 'tempcontact' element in domain, new technical check interface
	... see changelog of XML schemas.

version 1.3.0

	* The client provided values which caused errors repeated in error
	message are now taken directly from input document, rather than
	constructed ad-hoc as it was before. At source code level this implies
	that parsed document and its context must be attached to command
	structure and is freed after the whole request is proccessed.

	* New CORBA backend which exploits better possibility of exceptions
	is in place. The return codes are no more overloaded.

	* Functions for logging were exported in other components of mod_eppd.
	This results in better error reporting in log file, which was not
	possible when we identified problem just based on return code.

	* The code of epp-client.c was restructured and is more readable than
	it was.

version 1.2.1

	* Bugfix - instead of EPP protocol version was in greeting mod_eppd's
	version.

version 1.2.0

	* ... major rebuild of all source files and code cleanup

	* New memory allocator. Memory is now allocated from pools and freed
	all at once when request processing is over.

	* Structure for lists 'circ_list' was replaced by 'qhead' and 'qitem'.

	* The mega-structure containing all possible request was parted
	in smaller peaces, which ease manipulation.

	* New reference manager mod_corba was added, mod_eppd was adapted
	to changed reference management policy. Now each connection has
	its own unique CORBA reference.

	* As a side effect of changes in reference management code, the
	apache can be started without omninames running. The object references
	are obtained and resolved upon request arrival.

	* The epp-client.c file (CORBA component) was made bullet-proof
	against possible memory allocation failures.

	* Exceptions in CORBA functions are used instead of the hack
	(svTRID == 0).

	* All errors are translated on CR side from now (even libxml errors).

	* Extension handling mechanism was changed in order to make adding
	of new extensions easier (DNSSEC extension was dropped for now).

	* Handling of period in renew and create was changed. The period
	is now structured as 'value' and 'unit'. No conversion to months
	is done on behalf of mod_eppd.

	* Support for update of status flags was removed.

	* New EPP command 'sendAuthInfo' was implemented.

	* New EPP command for credit balance retrieval (creditInfo) was added.

	* New EPP command for trigering of technical check on nsset was added.

	* New attribute of nsset 'reportlevel' was added. This attribute is
	related to technical checks.

	* XML documents sent in response to EPP commands are from now logged to
	central register over corba.

	* Script for regular update of CRL is now part of mod_eppd
	distribution.

	* Changes in schema files (see ChangeLog in subdirectory schemas).
	The versions on most schema files were bumped up.

version 1.1.1

	* AuthInfo parameter when creating an object is not mandatory parameter
	anymore but optional.

	* Missing attribute 'lang' in reason element in check response was
	added.

	* Schema changes (see ChangeLog in schema subdirectory).

version 1.1.0

	* First version targeted for production release (does not have a tag
	in repository).
